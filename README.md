# udacity-deeplearning
Repository for Udacity's deep learning nanodegree.

This nanodegree is a hands-on and practical introduction to applied ML with tensorflow. There are 4 different topics tackled in the nanodegree:

* Introduction to Neural Networks.
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with an image classification project.
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with a language translation project and a script generation (both using LSTMs).
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with a face generation project.

Since I already had knowledge on the theory behind of most of these techniques and I wanted to have a wider portfolio, this Udacity nanodegree helped with the logistics and schedule. Overall, I wished it was more challenging.
